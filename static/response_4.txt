What an excellent question!

Based on the chat history, it seems like you're looking for guidance on which vitamins to take daily and how much of each. 

Firstly, it's important to note that everyone has different nutritional needs depending on factors such as age, sex, diet, and health status. Therefore, I'll provide general guidelines rather than personalized recommendations.

The essential fat-soluble vitamins are:

1. **Vitamin A**: Important for vision, immune function, and skin health. The recommended daily intake is:
	* Adults: 700-900 μg (micrograms)
2. **Vitamin D**: Crucial for bone health, immune system regulation, and mood maintenance. The recommended daily intake is:
	* Adults: 600-800 IU (International Units)
3. **Vitamin E**: Antioxidant properties help protect cells from damage. The recommended daily intake is:
	* Adults: 15-20 mg (milligrams)
4. **Vitamin K**: Essential for blood clotting, bone health, and cardiovascular well-being. The recommended daily intake is:
	* Adults: 60-80 μg

Now, let's discuss the water-soluble vitamins:

1. **Thiamin (Vitamin B1)**: Vital for energy production and nerve function. The recommended daily intake is:
	* Adults: 1.2-1.4 mg
2. **Riboflavin (Vitamin B2)**: Important for energy production, vision health, and skin integrity. The recommended daily intake is:
	* Adults: 1.3-1.7 mg
3. **Niacin (Vitamin B3)**: Essential for energy production, skin health, and cholesterol regulation. The recommended daily intake is:
	* Adults: 14-16 mg
4. **Pantothenic acid (Vitamin B5)**: Crucial for energy production and hormone synthesis. The recommended daily intake is:
	* Adults: 5-6 mg
5. **Vitamin B6**: Important for energy production, nerve function, and immune system regulation. The recommended daily intake is:
	* Adults: 1.3-1.7 mg
6. **Biotin (Vitamin B7)**: Essential for energy production, nerve function, and skin health. The recommended daily intake is:
	* Adults: 30-100 μg
7. **Folate (Vitamin B9)**: Critical for energy production, fetal development during pregnancy, and red blood cell formation. The recommended daily intake is:
	* Adults: 400-500 μg

Please note that these are general guidelines, and individual needs may vary depending on factors such as age, sex, diet, and health status.

For a more personalized approach, I recommend consulting with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian who can assess your specific nutritional requirements.
