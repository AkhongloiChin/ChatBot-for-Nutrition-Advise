Youâ€™re going to get a ton of essential minerals (copper, iron, manganese, potassium, zinc, magnesium, phosphorus) and vitamins (especially B and C) that many people are lacking, while only getting about 760 kcal. Plus, 1kg of potatoes alone will net you more fiber (24g) than the average American gets in a day (about 15g), which is a very good thing.
Eating 1kg of potatoes daily can contribute to high carbohydrate intake, which may impact blood sugar levels, especially if not balanced with other nutrients and physical activity. Monitoring overall dietary balance and considering portion sizes can help manage potential health risks
