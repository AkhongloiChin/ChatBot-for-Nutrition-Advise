A great follow-up question! 

While I understand the enthusiasm for supplementing with vitamin C, taking 10 effervescent tablets per day might not be the best approach. Here's why:

1. **Overdose risk**: Taking an excessive amount of vitamin C can lead to gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. The recommended daily intake is 60-90 mg for adult women and 90-120 mg for adult men.
2. **Lack of regulation**: Dietary supplements, including effervescent tablets, are not regulated by the FDA in the same way as prescription medications. This means there may be variability in the quality and potency of these products.
3. **Interactions with other nutrients**: Vitamin C can interact with other nutrients, such as iron, copper, and potassium, potentially affecting their absorption or utilization.
4. **Limited scientific support**: There is limited scientific evidence to support the claim that taking 10 effervescent tablets per day provides any additional benefits beyond the recommended daily intake.

Instead of relying on a large number of supplements, consider the following:

1. **Eat a balanced diet**: Focus on consuming whole foods rich in vitamin C, such as citrus fruits, strawberries, bell peppers, and leafy greens.
2. **Consult with a healthcare professional**: Discuss your dietary needs and concerns with a registered dietitian or healthcare provider. They can help you determine the best course of action for your individual situation.

Remember, it's always important to prioritize a balanced diet and consult with a healthcare professional before starting any supplement regimen.
