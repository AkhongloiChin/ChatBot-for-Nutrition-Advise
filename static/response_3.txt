The query is asking if 1kg of boiled potatoes per day is sufficient for minimum calorie consumption for a normal human. To answer this question, we need to consider the daily caloric needs of an average adult.

According to various sources, the recommended daily intake of calories for an adult is around 2,000-2,500 calories per day, depending on factors such as age, sex, weight, and activity level.

One kilogram of boiled potatoes contains approximately 3700-4000 calories, depending on their moisture content. This amount of potatoes would provide a significant portion of the recommended daily caloric intake.

However, it's essential to consider that a diet consisting solely of boiled potatoes would be lacking in essential nutrients like protein, healthy fats, and fiber. A well-balanced diet should include a variety of foods from all food groups to ensure adequate nutrient intake.

In conclusion, while 1kg of boiled potatoes per day might provide a significant portion of the recommended daily caloric intake, it is not considered sufficient for minimum calorie consumption due to its lack of essential nutrients.
