Vitamins are in a balance in the body the way nature or God designed. Vitamin C is in a direct balance with vitamin A. If you take too much of one without the other in a proper ratio you are causing harm to certain physiological processes.

First of all, the body does not utilize more than 250mg of vitamin C at a time . You would need a time release pill to utilize 1,000 mg over a day.

About 800mcg is recommended of vitamin A per day. then about 15 minutes of sunshine to manufacture what you need of vitamin D which is accomplished by your liver. In the current advent of COVID-19 it is not a bad idea to take extra vitamin C and zinc as well which has shown in many individuals to lessen the effects of the virus.

Never take large amounts of vitamins long-term, however. It is a good idea to take vitamins three weeks out of the month and stop for the fourth week so that the body can re-establish the normal homeostasis. There are other nutrients as well that are in balance with vitamin C and A that I won't go into here. This is the recommendation of somebody who has taken bio chemistry and nutrition as a PhD. I hope it helps your understanding.
