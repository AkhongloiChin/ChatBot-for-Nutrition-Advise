Based on my research, I can provide you with some helpful information!

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the recommended daily intake of vitamin C for adults is 90 milligrams (mg) per day. One medium-sized apple contains about 10 mg of vitamin C.

So, let's calculate how many apples would be needed to meet the daily requirement:

90 mg (daily requirement) รท 10 mg (per apple) = 9 apples

In other words, it would take approximately 9 medium-sized apples a day to satisfy the daily vitamin C requirement of an adult. However, please note that this calculation assumes you're consuming only apples as your source of vitamin C.

In reality, most people get their vitamin C from a balanced diet that includes a variety of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Additionally, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian for personalized nutrition advice.

Hope this information helps!
