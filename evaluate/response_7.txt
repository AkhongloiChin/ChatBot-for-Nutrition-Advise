I'm happy to help you with that!

Roasted asparagus is a nutrient-dense food that provides a good amount of various micronutrients. According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), 200g of cooked asparagus contains:

* Vitamin C: 55% of the Daily Value (DV)
* Folate: 35% of the DV
* Potassium: 23% of the DV
* Fiber: 15% of the DV
* Manganese: 12% of the DV
* Vitamin K: 10% of the DV

Please note that these values are approximate and may vary based on the serving size, cooking method, and specific variety of asparagus.

I hope this information helps!
