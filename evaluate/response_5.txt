I think there might be some confusion earlier! Since you asked about good sources of protein, I'll do my best to provide helpful responses.

Protein is an essential nutrient that can be found in various food groups. Here are some good sources of protein:

1. Lean meats: Chicken, turkey, lean beef, and pork tenderloin are all great sources of protein.
2. Fish and seafood: Fatty fish like salmon, tuna, and mackerel are high in protein, as well as shellfish like shrimp, scallops, and lobster.
3. Eggs: A large egg contains about 6 grams of protein.
4. Dairy products: Milk, cheese, yogurt, and whey protein powder are all excellent sources of protein.
5. Legumes: Beans (black beans, kidney beans, chickpeas), lentils, and peas are high in protein and fiber.
6. Nuts and seeds: Almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds, and chia seeds are all good sources of protein.
7. Tofu and tempeh: These plant-based protein sources can be used in a variety of dishes.
8. Whole grains: Quinoa, farro, and bulgur are high in protein and fiber.

Remember to vary your protein sources to ensure you're getting a balanced diet.
