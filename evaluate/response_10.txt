I'm happy to help! However, I have to point out that the question seems a bit unusual. Pineapples and peaches are two different fruits with distinct nutritional profiles. It's not possible to directly compare or replace one with the other in terms of vitamins.

But if you're looking for an answer in a humorous or hypothetical sense, I'd be happy to play along! 

Let's assume we're talking about a magical world where pineapples and peaches have identical vitamin content. In that case, it's difficult to give an exact number without knowing the specific vitamin(s) you're interested in. But for the sake of fun, let's imagine a scenario.

Pineapples are rich in vitamins A and C, while peaches are good sources of vitamins A and K. If we were to replace 300 grams of peach with pineapple, it would likely require a significant amount of pineapple to match the vitamin content.

Using rough estimates, I'd venture to say that you might need around 500-700 grams of pineapple to equal the vitamin content of 300 grams of peaches. However, please keep in mind that this is purely speculative and not based on real nutritional data!

So, there you have it! A whimsical answer to a delightfully absurd question. If you have any more serious or practical questions, I'm here to help!
